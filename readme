Perl script to print the instances of all ints and floats of a program in a text file.

The input and output file path should be specified as command line arguments.

For example: ./f.pl -v -i <inputfilepath> -o <outputfilepath>

-v symbolizes that only variables have to be reported. -f instead would report function names as well
