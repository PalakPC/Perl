Perl script to print the instances of all ints and floats of code written in a file to another file along with line number.

The input and otuput files should both be specified as a command-line arguments.

Run the script as follows:
./ifprint.pl --v --i <input file name> --o <output file name>

'v' symbolizes that only variables have to be reported. 'f' instead would report function names as well.
Only 'v' and 'f' can be used.
